# Bank Marketing Classification using TensorFlow/Keras

This repository contains code for building and evaluating a machine learning model for binary classification on bank marketing data using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Description

The code provided here performs the following tasks:
- Loads the bank marketing dataset from a CSV file.
- Explores and visualizes the data to understand its distribution and relationships.
- Preprocesses the data by encoding categorical variables, creating interaction features, and standardizing numerical features.
- Builds a neural network model using TensorFlow and Keras for binary classification.
- Trains the model on the training data and evaluates its performance on the test data.
- Visualizes the confusion matrix to understand the model's predictive performance.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed-eldesoky284/Market-Segmentation-with-Neural-Networks.git
   cd Market-Segmentation-with-Neural-Networks

2. **Install Dependencies:**

  Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using:
  ```
  pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
  ```
3- **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

  Open the provided Jupyter Notebook 
  (Untitled.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab and execute each cell sequentially. Make sure to have the CSV 
  file (bank-additional-full.csv) in the same directory.

4. **Interpret the Results:**
   After running the notebook, observe the output to understand the data distribution, model training process, and evaluation results.


## File Structure
  `Market Segmentation with Neural Network.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building,
  and evaluation.
  `bank-additional-full.csv`: CSV file containing the bank marketing dataset.
